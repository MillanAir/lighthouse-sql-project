# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)
Goals of the project was to load the raw csv tables into a sql database and performing queries to categorize the data into meaningful results. For Eg. Generating a Table of Revenue according to the top Countries and Cities.


## Process
### (your step 1)
1. Creating tables and filling in the columns with correct data types and then loading the CSV file into pgadmin for executing queries
2. Cleaning the data, getting rid of dupicate, empty values and columns, and to make data workable
### (your step 2)
1. Finding results based on different queries
## Results
1. In my search, **United States** was among the top Countries with total Revenue of *$13,154.17* & *San Fransisco* was top on the list with *$1564.32* in revenue.
2. In Cities, **San Bruno** has the on average 52.66 products ordered/sold
3. 

## Challenges 
1. Missing values were a challenge to me
2. There are values that were present in some table but missing in other tables hindering my QA Process
3. 

## Future Goals
1. I would like to find time and formulas for filling out missing values
2. Clean the data to make it normalized at least 2NF or best 3NF by creating primary keys and removing all null values, which will give me a way to analyze data more accurately
